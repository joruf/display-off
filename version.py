"""
Which state of Display Off is running, derived from the commit history.

Nobody raises the number by hand, so it cannot be forgotten and cannot lie. It
works the same way as in the other projects (Mint Cleaner, Startup Launcher):

    major  raised by hand, and only for a release that genuinely justifies it
    minor  number of commits that added a new Python module, which is where a new
           capability lands (``__init__.py``, tests and the build files aside)
    patch  commits since that last happened
    build  total number of commits

So "0.2.5 (14)" means: the 14th commit, the second time a module arrived, five
changes since then. The initial import counts as the first arrival, so the first
working state is 0.1.x. The tag of a release is ``v<version>-build<build>``.

One source, three routes to it, tried in this order:

    DISPLAY_OFF_VERSION   a fixed value, for tests and for a one-off run
    git history     a checkout, which is every development machine
    VERSION file    an installation without .git, and the single-file
                    executable, which carries it

The VERSION file is written by ``build-exe.py`` (or ``python3 version.py --write``)
and is not checked in: it is derived, and a checked-in copy would be stale one
commit later. The executable never reads git: its copy lives in the folder it
unpacks itself into.

There is deliberately no invented fallback such as 0.0.0: an unknown version says
so. This module imports nothing from Display Off, so the build and the release
workflow can run it on its own.
